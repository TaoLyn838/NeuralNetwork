Why we need to use Multilayer perceptron:  In 1969, Minsky and Papert highlights that 
    "the fact that Perceptron, with only one neuron, canâ€™t be applied to non-linear data."
    And, "The Multilayer Perceptron was developed to tackle this limitation. It is a neural network where the 
    mapping between inputs and output is non-linear." (Carolina Bento)

An algorithm that classifies input by separating two categories with a straight line. 
    Input is typically a feature vector x multiplied by weights w and added to a bias b: y = w * x + b. (Jorge Leonel)

The bias can be thought of as how much flexible the perceptron is. It is somehow similar to the constant
    b of a linear function y = ax + b. It allows us to move the line up and down to fit the prediction 
    with the data better. Without b the line will always goes through the origin (0, 0) and you may get 
    a poorer fit. (Jorge Leonel)
